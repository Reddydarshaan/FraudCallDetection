# FraudCallDetection

# Overview
FraudCallDetection is an application designed to identify and flag fraudulent phone calls, with a strong focus on detecting deepfake audio using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. Developed as a tool to combat the rising threat of phone-based scams, including AI-generated fraudulent calls, this project aims to protect users by analyzing suspicious call patterns and providing actionable insights in real-time.

# Features
# Deepfake Detection:
Identifies AI-generated or manipulated audio (deepfakes) in calls using advanced audio analysis techniques, making it a core component of fraud prevention.
# Call Analysis:
Analyzes call metadata (e.g., duration, frequency, caller ID) to identify potential fraud.
# Machine Learning Model:
Uses supervised learning to classify calls as "fraudulent" or "legitimate" based on historical data and deepfake audio signatures.
# Real-Time Detection:
Provides instant alerts for suspicious incoming calls, prioritizing deepfake identification.
# User Reporting:
Allows users to report fraudulent calls to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy, including deepfake-related feedback.
# Customizable Rules:
Supports user-defined rules for flagging specific call behaviors, with options to target deepfake patterns.
